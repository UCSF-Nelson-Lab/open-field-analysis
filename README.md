# open-field-analysis
This python script takes raw open field analysis data in an excel spreadsheet and calculates the average metrics for velocity, rotations (both clockwise and counterclockwise), and distance moved.

You can access the excel files containing the raw data and the analyzed output data in the data folder. You can use the raw data as sample inputs for the Python Jupyter notebook.

For A1-A3-B4-B0-B2-B5-C2-D1-D2-3-weeks-open-field-analysis.xlsx, there is another sheet named "Manually-Computed-Metrics" containing the average metrics that were manually calculated in Excel by selecting the appropriate rows and columns and using the AVERAGE formula on them. These manually computed metrics were used to confirm that the script was correctly calculating the metrics, which is outputted to another spreadsheet called 'Metrics.'
